			I grew up in rural southeastern Minnesota and currently live and work in 
			Chicagoâ€™s Rogers Park neighborhood, at home in my menagerie of ungovernable 
			succulents, cacti, and hanging ferns. I learned metalsmithing and gemology 
			at The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) before going on to earn a BFA 
			from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago where my focus was sustainable 
			design. In between, I also studied natural science at De Paul.
